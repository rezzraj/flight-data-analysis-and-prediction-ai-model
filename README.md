 Overview
This project analyzes and models flight booking data scraped from a popular travel website. The dataset contains flight travel details between major Indian cities. The aim is to explore the data, visualize key insights, and train ML models to predict airline ticket prices based on several features.

Dataset Features
The dataset includes the following columns:

Airline: Name of the airline company (6 unique airlines)

Flight: Flight code (categorical)

Source City: Departure city (6 unique cities)

Departure Time: Categorized time bins of departure (6 time labels)

Stops: Number of stops (3 distinct values)

Arrival Time: Categorized time bins of arrival (6 time labels)

Destination City: Arrival city (6 unique cities)

Class: Travel class - Business or Economy

Duration: Total travel time (continuous feature in hours)

Days Left: Days left from booking date to travel date

Price: 🎯 Target variable (flight price in INR)

🤖 Model Training & Evaluation
Two machine learning models were trained using Scikit-learn:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Models use key features like airline, cities, class, departure time, etc., to predict ticket prices between cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Chennai.

Model	Accuracy (R² Score)	Error Margin (₹)	Predicted Ticket Price
Random Forest Regressor	0.91	₹3676.83	₹13,506.51
Linear Regression	0.90	₹4461.07	₹7173.56

 Random Forest Regressor showed better accuracy and lower error margin.

 Data Analysis & Visualizations
Using Seaborn, several visual insights were generated (see visualizations/ folder):

Total cities analyzed: 6

Longest Flight: Air India

Most Economical Airline: AirAsia

Most Expensive Airline: Vistara

Average Price by Airline:

AirAsia = ₹4,091.07

Indigo = ₹5,324.22

GO_FIRST = ₹5,652.01

SpiceJet = ₹6,179.28

Air India = ₹23,507.02

Vistara = ₹30,396.54

 AirAsia offers the best value for money overall.
